# Thoughts App

### Goals
  Full stack application using passport.js to authorize users on the back-end. I'm practicing with auth0 because I'll be implementing this great technology shortly on some passion projects. The user, and role system within auth0 is out of this world, and great for most projects that require different level of users, with different authorization access. 

  
  Side note:
  I've had some bad luck getting local repository commit history to show on my last few baby apps, so I'm making sure to include proper cataloguing in this baby application. 

### Tech
  * Next.js
  * React-strap for styling
  * Auth0 
  * Express.js + Node.js
